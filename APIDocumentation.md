# FinSight API – Backend Documentation

This document describes the REST API for **FinSight**, a personal finance dashboard backend built with **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Clerk authentication**.  
The API is deployed on **Google Cloud Run** and serves a React frontend hosted separately.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

- Authentication is handled using **Clerk**
- Protected routes require a valid Clerk session
- Backend uses:
  - `clerkMiddleware()` (global)
  - `requireAuth()` on protected route groups
  - `getAuth(req)` to extract `userId`

### Authorization Header
All protected endpoints require:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <CLERK_JWT>

If authentication fails, the API returns:

```json 
{ "message": "Not authenticated" }
```

** 🌍 Base URLs **
